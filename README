This plugin adds a message displaying the number of characters remaining in an input or textarea when they have a maxlength set. It's a bit rough around the edges, but I needed a fairly basic solution quickly and most of the existing plugins that offer a similar function were too big, too small, or didn't meet my specific needs. If this looks like it will work for you, feel free to use it!

Highlights:
- Less than 2KB minified.
- Adds a warning class to the message when the character limit has nearly been reached (useful for changing the color of the message text via CSS)
- Uses .prop() and .attr() correctly (.attr() is often used incorrectly for setting/getting DOM properties)
- Multiple instances can be used on the same page
  - Can be used on individual form elements with unique options for each element
  - Can be used on multiple form elements with the same options
- Has built-in options for basic customization
- Remaining character message can be customized via $.fn.SimpleMaxChars.message = function(){ yourCustomFunction });
- Tested with jQuery 1.7.1, IE8, IE9, Chrome 17
