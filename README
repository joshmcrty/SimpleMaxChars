This plugin adds a message displaying the number of characters remaining in an input or textarea when they have a maxlength set. It's a bit rough around the edges, but I needed a fairly basic solution quickly and most of the existing plugins that offer a similar function were too big, too small, or didn't meet my specific needs. If this looks like it will work for you, feel free to use it!

Highlights:
- Less than 2KB minified.
- Uses .prop() and .attr() correctly (.attr() is often used incorrectly for setting/getting DOM properties)
- Can be used on individual elements with unique options for each element
- Can be used on multiple elements with the same options
- Message formatting function can be customized via $.fn.SimpleMaxChars.message = function(){ customFunction });
